## PERSONAL LEARNINGS:

Very lenghty and complex project to start PHP and WordPress. Understanding the WordPress hierarchy was crucial to acomplish thee building goals. Not only for the structuring itself but for the SCSS which compiled most of the project. I wish this was project 5 instead. Other than that, a great learning experience.  

## Installation

### 1. Download me (don't clone me!)

Then add me to your `wp-content` directory.

### 2. Rename the `redstarter-master` directory

Make sure that the theme directory name is project appropriate for your taste!

### 3. Install the dev dependencies

Next you'll need to run `npm install` **inside your theme directory** next to install the node modules you'll need for Gulp, etc.

### 4. Update the proxy in `gulpfile.js`

Lastly, be sure to update your `gulpfile.js` with the appropriate URL for the Browsersync proxy (so change `localhost[:port-here]/[your-dir-name-here]` to the appropriate localhost URL).
